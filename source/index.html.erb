    <h1>Crowdsource digital tasks to a community you create</h1>
    <p>
      OpenGuilds is a platform to build crowdsourced organizations that can 
      scale to thousands of individuals.

    <h2>Crowdsource a Workforce of Your Control</h2>
    <strong>
      Guilds are created with a transparent constitution of your creation.
    </strong>
    <p>
      Guilds are established with a set of transparent rules, written into a guild's
      constitution. The constitution outlines how workers are onboarded or promoted,
      how rewards are distributed, and how the rules themselves can be changed.
    </p>


    <strong>
      Skilled workers join guilds, gain qualifications, and are rewarded for their work.
    </strong>
    <p>
      Guilds are only limited by the number of members they can attract. No more overhead, members are
      rewarded directly based on the merit of their work done. Guilds can process one
      task a day, or thousands, the only limit is the guild's total membership.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="layers">
    <h2>Guilds Have Layers</h2>
    <p>
    Guilds support advanced workflows by pushing work done through layers. A layer defines
    how the work in a previous layer should be transformed and output to the next.
    In this way simple tasks done by different workers can be combined to give accurate
    results.
    </p>

    <p>
    Workers can be promoted automatically through to more trusted layers by completing
    tasks correctly according to the guild's constitution. Deeper layers are more subjective
    and can be used to combine or enhance submitted work from previous workers.
    </p>

  <section class="work">
    <h2>Open Guilds Work</h2>
    <p>
    Imagine a large outer circle and smaller inner circle. Most work done by guilds
    such as image labelling, are easy and verifiable. They are done as much as possible
    by the outer circle, consisting of crowdsourced workers from outside your organization.
    When a subjective or expert opinion is needed, or workers disagree on an answer,
    the work can be passed to the more trusted inner circle for verification. This is
    a simple example of how Open Guilds provide quality control.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="rewards">
    <h2>Workers Are Rewarded</h2>
    <p>
    A guild multiplies its productivity by promoting good workers through its layers
    for greater rewards and more trusted work. This allows for the scalability that
    makes crowdsourcing attractive.
    </p>

    <p>
    Workers can be members of multiple guilds and gain qualifications for many different
    kinds of digital work. They are not dependent on a single guild for their livelihood
    in the same way a guild is not dependent on any single worker.
