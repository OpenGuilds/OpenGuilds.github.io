    <h2>Crowdsource a Workforce of Your Control</h2>
    <strong>
      Guilds are created with a transparent constitution of your creation.
    </strong>
    <p>
      Guilds are established with a set of transparent rules, written into a guild's
      constitution. The constitution outlines how workers are onboarded or promoted,
      how rewards are distributed, and how the rules themselves can be changed.
    </p>


    <strong>
      Skilled workers join guilds, gain qualifications, and are rewarded for their work.
    </strong>
    <p>
      Guilds are only limited by the number of members they can attract. No more overhead, members are
      rewarded directly based on the merit of their work done. Guilds can process one
      task a day, or thousands, the only limit is the guild's total membership.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="layers">
    <h2>Guilds Have Layers</h2>
    <p>
    Guilds support advanced workflows by pushing work done through layers. A layer defines
    how the work in a previous layer should be transformed and output to the next.
    In this way simple tasks done by different workers can be combined to give accurate
    results.
    </p>

    <p>
    Workers can be promoted automatically through to more trusted layers by completing
    tasks correctly according to the guild's constitution. Deeper layers are more subjective
    and can be used to combine or enhance submitted work from previous workers.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="work">
    <h2>Open Guilds Work</h2>
    <p>
    Imagine a large outer circle and smaller inner circle. Most work done by guilds
    such as image labelling, are easy and verifiable. They are done as much as possible
    by the outer circle, consisting of crowdsourced workers from outside your organization.
    When a subjective or expert opinion is needed, or workers disagree on an answer,
    the work can be passed to the more trusted inner circle for verification. This is
    a simple example of how Open Guilds provide quality control.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="rewards">
    <h2>Workers Are Rewarded</h2>
    <p>
    A guild multiplies its productivity by promoting good workers through its layers
    for greater rewards and more trusted work. This allows for the scalability that
    makes crowdsourcing attractive.
    </p>

    <p>
    Workers can be members of multiple guilds and gain qualifications for many different
    kinds of digital work. They are not dependent on a single guild for their livelihood
    in the same way a guild is not dependent on any single worker.

  <p>
  Governments can use a guilds network during times of crisis to
            identify issues on the ground in areas that still
            have mobile networks. NGO's are able to get valuable data
            from tougher economic zones where cellphone penetration but lacks
            other infrastructure for effective surveying.

  <p>
  Businesses can use a guild to handle normally difficult to scale
    processes as they grow without increasing overhead. Tasks such as directing
    customer questions to the appropriate knowledge repository, or labelling
    valuable data that needs human intervention.

  <p>
  Entrepreneurs can create flexible organizations which are competitive
          with large competitors without the overhead that requires upfront
          capital investment. The people needed can be added exactly with the
          incomming demand, creating a automatic scaling of new business processes.

    <h3>Everyone</h3>
  </header>

  <p>
  Everyone can use a guild to perform meaningful work online with others.
            Even those outside of the normal economic opportunity can do 
            work and provide for themselves with nothing but a cellphone and
            internet connection.
